# IMTCodeHub


Welcome to my repository! Here, you'll find a collection of programs I've created during my time at Instituto Mau√° de Tecnologia (IMT), starting from my 3rd year (5th semester) onwards. Most of these programs are mainly written in C# and Java, but you might also find some in other languages. 

Some programs here were also made in collaboration with other students. I'll leave their names in the code when that's the case.
